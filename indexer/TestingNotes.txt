Assignment 3 notes:

TAInput.tar is for assignment 3.
Here are the 10 test cases and grading policy we use for assignment 3:

1) Basic file argument ----- 9 pts
2) Nonexistent file as argument ----- 3 pts
3) Shallow directory (no nesting) as argument ----- 9 pts
4) Shallow directory as argument, no files inside ----- 3 pts
5) Nested directory as argumen ----- 9 pts
6) 1 nested directory without files ----- 3 pts
7) 1 word with more than 5 records ----- 9 pts
8) crazy non-alphanumeric delimiters in files
(spaces in the others above) ----- 9 pts
9) Too many arguments ----- 3 pts
10) Too few arguments ----- 3 pts

Total for test cases: 60 pts.
Makefile: 10 pts.
Readme: 10 pts.
Testplan: 20 pts.



Some notes about the test cases:
1. For  test cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: unzip the attachment to get the "TAInput"
folder. Test your program with something like this: 

./indexer output.txt path/test3

where "indexer" is replaced with whatever your executable is named, and "path" is
replace with the absolute or relative path to the "TAInput/" folder.

2. For test case 2: replace path/test3 with a non-existing file or directory.

3. For test cases 9, 10: test your program with less or more than 2 arguments.

4. Test case 2, 4, 6, 9, 10 should output things like bad input, non-existing file
or simply no output. Generally, if your program does not break (e.g., segmentation
		fault) on those cases, you'll get full credit for them.

5. Your output tokens/terms should be case-insensitive, in ascending sorted order
based on the ASCII coding of characters; Your file+frequency output under each
term should be in descending sorted order based on frequency counts; Each line
should contain no more than 5 records of file+frequency.

6. Sample output is also attached (end-of-line in Linux format).
